Nmap is an extrememly powerful tool for pen testing, PyNmapGUI offers a graphical user interface to scan networks as an alternative to ZenMap.

Here's why:
* Beginners shouldn't worry about crafting verbose command line arguments at first, they should get hands on with the tool
* You shouldn't be typing the same bash command, trying different configs, and making sure you save the output
* Trying Nmap should be easy to try:smile:

Of course, this tool does not exist as a replacement to command line Nmap usage. This tool serves as a means to run basic Nmap commands within a graphical interface.

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org)
* [python-nmap](https://xael.org/norman/python/python-nmap/)
* [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get PyNmapGUI up and running locally, [Python3.5<](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/) must be installed and added to PATH.  

### Prerequisites
Additional prerequisites to get PyNmapGUI up and running.
* Update pip3 for most Linux ditros
```sh
sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip
```
* Update pip3 for Windows
```sh
python3 -m pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https:://github.com/nlopez99/PyNmapGUI.git
```
2. Pip3 install packages
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Install NMAP `nmap`
```sh
sudo apt-get install nmap
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
